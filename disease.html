            <pre>
	
Viral diseases are extremely widespread infections caused by viruses, a type of microorganism. There are many types of viruses that cause <br>
 a wide variety of viral diseases. The most common type of viral disease is the common cold, which is caused by a viral infection of the upper <br>
  respiratory tract (nose and throat). Other common viral diseases include:

<li>Chickenpox</li>

<li>Flu (influenza)</li>

<li>Herpes</li>

<li> Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS)</li>

<li> Human papillomavirus (HPV)</li>

<li> Infectious mononucleosis</li>

<li> Mumps, measles and rubella</li>

<li> Shingles </li>

<li> Viral gastroenteritis (stomach flu) </li>

<li> Viral hepatitis</li>

<li> Viral meningitis</li>

<li> Viral pneumonia</li>

Viral diseases are contagious and spread from person to person when a virus enters the body and begins to multiply. Common ways that <br>
 viruses spread from person to person include:

Having sexual contact with a person who is infected with a sexually transmitted virus

Indirect transmission from person to person by a virus host, such as a mosquito, tick, or field mouse

Touching surfaces or body fluids contaminated with a virus

Viral diseases result in a wide variety of symptoms that vary in character and severity depending on the type of viral infection and other <br>
 factors, including the person’s age and overall health. Common symptoms of viral diseases include flu-like symptoms and malaise.

Viral diseases are not treatable with antibiotics, which can only cure bacterial diseases and infections. However, the most common viral diseases,<br>
 the common cold and the flu, are self-limiting in generally healthy people. This means that the viral infection causes illness for a period of time,<br>
  then it resolves and symptoms disappear as your immune system attacks the virus and your body recovers.

In some cases, viral diseases can lead to serious, possibly life-threatening complications, such as dehydration, bacterial pneumonia, and other <br>
 
secondary bacterial infections. People at risk for complications include those who have a chronic disease or a suppressed or<br> compromised immune system,
 
and the very young and very old. In addition, certain types of sexually transmitted viral infections, such as HIV/AIDS and HPV, can <br>lead to serious complications 
 
and death. Seek prompt medical care if you think you have a viral disease, especially if you are at risk for complications, or if <br>you believe you have been 
 
exposed to a sexually transmitted disease.

Seek immediate medical care (call 911) if you, or someone you are with, have serious symptoms of an illness or a viral disease,<br>
 such as shortness of breath, chest pain, passing out (fainting), or a change in alertness or consciousness.


Symptoms

<h3> What are the symptoms of viral diseases?</h3>

Causes

<h3>What causes viral diseases?</h3>
Viral infections occur when a virus enters the body and <br>
invades the inside of the body’s cells in order to reproduce.<br>
 If the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the virus,<br>
  it multiplies and spreads to other cells, repeating the process<br>
   and leading to a widespread infection.

<h1>Types of viruses</h1>
There are many types of viruses that cause a wide variety of viral infections or viral diseases. In fact,
 <br> there are more than 200 different viruses that can cause a cold or an   upper respiratory infection.
<br>  Other common viruses include the following:;


<li> Epstein-Barr virus causes infectious mononucleosis (cytomegalovirus causes a very similar disease in some people)</li>.

<li> Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes AIDS.</li>

<li> Human papillomaviruses (HPV) cause HPV infection, cervical dysplasia, genital warts, and cervical cancer.</li>

<li> Influenza viruses, such as H1N1, cause influenza (flu).</li>

<li> Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes lower respiratory tract infections in young children.</li>

<li> Rhinoviruses cause the common cold.</li>

<li> Rotavirus, enteroviruses and noroviruses cause viral gastroenteritis.
</li>

<li> Varicella zoster virus causes shingles and chickenpox.</li>

<li> West Nile virus causes West Nile fever.</li>

<h3> What are the risk factors for contracting viral diseases?</h3>
Viral diseases can occur in any age group or population. Everybody contracts viral diseases during their life, although in some cases,<br> the virus does not cause obvious symptoms. Risk factors for catching a viral disease or developing complications of a viral disease include:

Advanced age

Compromised immune system due to an immunodeficiency disorder, HIV/AIDS, cancer or cancer treatment, kidney disease, or other condition

History of chronic disease, such as asthma, COPD, diabetes, tuberculosis, or heart disease

Malnourishment

Not getting enough rest and having high levels of stress

Not washing your hands frequently, especially before eating or after using the restroom, or after touching common surfaces

Sharing needles to inject drugs or for tattooing

Unprotected sex including vaginal, oral and anal sex with a partner who has had one or more other sexual partners

Young age including infancy and elementary-school-age children

Reducing your risk of viral diseases
You can lower your risk of catching or spreading a viral disease by:

Abstaining from sexual activity, or only engaging in sexual activities within a mutually monogamous relationship in which <br>
 neither partner is infected with a sexually transmitted disease

Avoiding contact of your hands with your eyes, nose and mouth, which can transmit a virus into the body

Avoiding contact with a person who has a viral disease

Covering your mouth and nose with your elbow (not your hand) or a tissue when sneezing or coughing

Eating a well-balanced diet that includes sufficient amounts of fruits and vegetables

Sufficient rest

Using a new condom for each sex act

Using a sterile, unused needle for each act of tattooing or injectable drug use

Using appropriate antibacterial cleaners to clean your hands and surfaces

Vaccination as recommended by your health care provider for viral diseases, such as chickenpox, shingles, influenza, HPV, hepatitis B,<br>
 hepatitis A, measles, and mumps

Washing your hands with soap and water for at least 15 seconds after contact with a person who has a viral disease,<br>
 before eating, or after using the restroom or touching feces, body fluids, surfaces, or foods that are potentially contaminated with viruses
Treatments

<h3>How are viral diseases treated?</h3>
Treatment of viral infections varies depending on the specific virus and other factors. General treatment measures are aimed at relieving your<br>
 symptoms so that you can get the rest you need to keep up your strength and recover without developing complications.

General treatments for viral infections include:

Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) for fever, body aches, and pain

Drinking extra fluids

Getting extra rest and sleep

Maintaining good nutrition

Depending on the type of viral infection and the presence of complications, a wide variety of other treatments may be needed.<br>
 For example, a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection that leads to cervical dysplasia can be treated by surgical removal of the<br>
  abnormal cells on a woman’s cervix.   
In general, it is recommended that children younger than age six not use cold or cough medications because of the risk for serious <br>
 side effects. In addition, people with a viral disease should not use aspirin or products that contain aspirin because of the risk of<br>
  developing a rare but life-threatening condition called Reye syndrome. Reye syndrome has been linked to taking aspirin during a viral illness,
   such as a cold or the flu.

Prescription medications used to treat viral diseases
In some cases, certain medications may be prescribed to treat viral diseases:

Antiretroviral medications, which can help people with HIV/AIDS lead longer lives. Antiretroviral medications hinder the ability of HIV to reproduce,
 which slows the spread of HIV in the body.

Antiviral drugs, which minimize the severity and length of some viral infections, such as the flu and shingles, especially in people who are at a
 high risk for serious complications. For example, the drugs oseltamivir (brand name Tamiflu) and zanamivir (brand name Relenza) may be prescribed 
 for some cases of flu. These drugs are not appropriate for all people with the flu.

Antibiotics, which are not prescribed for viral diseases because they are ineffective in the treatment of viral infections, may be prescribed if a person
 with a viral disease develops a secondary bacterial infection, such as bacterial pneumonia, bacterial bronchitis, or encephalitis.

Complementary treatments
Complementary and traditional treatments will not cure a viral disease but may help to increase comfort, promote rest,
 and minimize symptoms of viral diseases.Some possible treatments include:

Chicken soup to help break up congestion and provide easy-to-digest nutrients and extra fluids to help keep up strength

Supplements or products that contain vitamin C, echinacea, or zinc

Using a vaporizer

Using mentholated ointments on the chest

What are the possible complications of viral diseases?
In some people, viral diseases can break down the body’s defenses and lead to more serious infections and
 life-threatening complications. Therefore, it is important to visit your health care provider when you have
  symptoms of a viral infection. Once the underlying infection has been determined, following the treatment 
  plan outlined by your health care provider can help reduce any potential complications including:

Acute bronchitis

Cervical cancer (from human papillomavirus infection)

Dehydration

Frequent life-threatening, opportunistic infections

Otitis media (ear infection)

Pneumonia

Secondary bacterial infection

Seizures

Shock and coma

Sinusitis

Worsening of asthma
