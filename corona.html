            <h1>What is COVID-19</h1>
            <pre>
	
                A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.

                In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
                
                COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).
                
                It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections range from mild to deadly.
                
                SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for otherwise healthy people.
                
               <b>Is there more than one strain of SARS-CoV-2?</b>
                
                An early Chinese study of 103 COVID-19 cases found two strains, which they named L and S. The S type is older, but the L type was more common in early stages of the outbreak. They think one may cause more cases of the disease than the other, but they’re still working on what it all means. 
                
                It is also normal for a virus to change, or mutate, as it infects people and this virus has done so. There are several variants which have been named for the regions they were first discovered but they have now spread to other areas and countries, some proving to be more contageous as well as more deadly. 
                
               <b>How long will the coronavirus last?</b>
                
                There's no way to tell how long the pandemic will continue. There are many factors, including the public’s efforts to slow the spread, researchers’ work to learn more about the virus, their search for a treatment, and the success of the vaccines.
                
               <b>Symptoms of COVID-19</b> 

                The main symptoms include:
                
                Fever

                Coughing

                Shortness of breath

                Trouble breathing

                Fatigue

                Chills, sometimes with shaking

                Body aches

                Headache

                Sore throat

                Congestion/runny nose

                Loss of smell or taste

                Nausea
                
                Diarrhea
            
                The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines. They can kill tissue and damage your organs.
                
                If you notice the following severe symptoms in yourself or a loved one, get medical help right away:
                
                Trouble breathing or shortness of breath
                Ongoing chest pain or pressure
                New confusion
                Can’t wake up fully
                Bluish lips or face
                Strokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19. Remember FAST:
                
               <b>Face.</b>Is one side of the person’s face numb or drooping? Is their smile lopsided?

               <b>Arms.</b>Is one arm weak or numb? If they try to raise both arms, does one arm sag?

               <b>Speech.</b>Can they speak clearly? Ask them to repeat a sentence.

               <b>Time.</b>Every minute counts when someone shows signs of a stroke. Call 911 right away.

                If you're infected, symptoms can show up in as few as 2 days or as many as 14. It varies from person to person.
                
                According to researchers in China, these were the most common symptoms among people who had COVID-19:
                
                Fever 99%

                Fatigue 70%

                Cough 59%

                Lack of appetite 40%

                Body aches 35%

                Shortness of breath 31%

                Mucus/phlegm 27%

                Some people who are hospitalized for COVID-19 have also have dangerous blood clots, including in their legs, lungs, and arteries.
                
               <b>What to do if you think you have it</b> 
                
                If you live in or have traveled to an area where COVID-19 is spreading:
                
               <b>If you don’t feel well, stay home.</b>  Even if you have mild symptoms like a headache and runny nose, stay in until you’re better. This lets doctors focus on people who are more seriously ill and protects health care workers and people you might meet along the way. You might hear this called self-quarantine. Try to stay in a separate room away from other people in your home. Use a separate bathroom if you can.

               <b></b> Call the doctor if you have trouble breathing.</b>  You need to get medical help as soon as possible. Calling ahead (rather than showing up) will let the doctor direct you to the proper place, which may not be your doctor’s office. If you don’t have a regular doctor, call your local board of health. They can tell you where to go for testing and treatment.

               <b>Follow your doctor’s advice and keep up with the news on COVID-19.</b>  Between your doctor and health care authorities, you’ll get the care you need and information on how to prevent the virus from spreading.

                For more information about COVID-19, see our FAQ.
                
               <b>How do I know if it’s COVID-19, a cold, or the flu?</b>
                
                Symptoms of COVID-19 can be similar to a bad cold or the flu. Your doctor will suspect COVID-19 if:
                
                You have a fever and a cough.
                You have been exposed to people who have it within the last 14 days.
                
               <b> Is COVID-19 worse than the flu?</b>
                
                Unlike the flu, a lot of people aren’t immune to the coronavirus because it’s so new. If you do catch it, the virus triggers your body to make things called antibodies. Researchers are looking at whether the antibodies give you protection against catching it again.
                
                The coronavirus also appears to cause higher rates of severe illness and death than the flu. But the symptoms themselves can vary widely from person to person.
                
                <b> Is COVID-19 seasonal like the flu?</b>
                
                While it had been helped in the first year that higher temperatures and humidity levels might help slow the spread of the coronavirus, that was not the case. Experts advise caution and say weather changes won’t matter without thorough public health efforts. Also, past flu pandemics have happened year-round.
                
            <b> Causes of the New Coronavirus</b>

                Researchers aren’t sure what caused it. There’s more than one type of coronavirus. They’re common in people and in animals including bats, camels, cats, and cattle. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is similar to MERS and SARS. They all came from bats.
                
            <b> Coronavirus Risk Factors</b>

                Anyone can get COVID-19, and most infections are mild. The older you are, the higher your risk of severe illness.
                
                You also a have higher chance of serious illness if you have one of these health conditions:
                
                Chronic kidney disease

                Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

                A weakened immune system because of an organ transplant

                Obesity

                Serious heart conditions such as heart failure or coronary artery disease

                Sickle cell disease


                Type 2 diabetes

                Conditions that could lead to severe COVID-19 illness include:
                
                Moderate to severe asthma

                Diseases that affect your blood vessels and blood flow to your brain

                Cystic fibrosis

                High blood pressure

                A weakened immune system because of a blood or bone marrow transplant, HIV, or medications like corticosteroids

                Dementia

                Liver disease

                Pregnancy

                Damaged or scarred lung tissue (pulmonary fibrosis)

                Smoking

                Thalassemia

                Type 1 diabetes

                Some children and teens who are in the hospital with COVID-19 have an inflammatory condition that doctors are calling multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Doctors think it may be linked to the virus. It causes symptoms similar to those of toxic shock and of Kawasaki disease, a condition that causes inflammation in kids’ blood vessels.
                
               <b> Coronavirus Transmission</b>

               <b> How does the coronavirus spread?</b>
                
                SARS-CoV-2, the virus, mainly spreads from person to person.
                
                Most of the time, it spreads when a sick person coughs or sneezes. They can spray aerosole droplets 6 feet away or even further. If you breathe them in or swallow them, the virus can get into your body. Some people who have the virus don't have symptoms, but they can still spread the virus.
                
                While less likely, you can also get the virus from touching a surface or object the virus is on, then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes. Most viruses can live for several hours on a surface that they land on. A study shows that SARS-CoV-2 can last for several hours on various types of surfaces:
                
                Copper (pennies, teakettles, cookware): 4 hours

                Cardboard (shipping boxes): up to 24 hours

                Plastic (milk containers, detergent bottles, subway and bus seats, elevator buttons):2 to 3 days

                Stainless steel (refrigerators, pots and pans, sinks, some water bottles): 2 to 3 days

                That’s why it’s important to disinfect surfaces to get rid of the virus.
                
                Some dogs and cats have tested positive for the virus. A few have shown signs of illness. There’s no evidence that humans can catch this coronavirus from an animal, but it appears it can be passed from humans to animals.
                
               <b> What is community spread?</b>
                
                Doctors and health officials use this term when they don’t know the source of the infection. With COVID-19, it usually refers to someone who gets the virus even though they haven’t been out of the country or haven’t been exposed to someone who’s traveled abroad or who has COVID-19.
                
                In February 2020, the CDC confirmed a COVID-19 infection in California in a person who had not traveled to an affected area or been exposed to someone with the disease. This marked the first instance of community spread in the U.S. It’s likely that person was exposed to someone who was infected but didn’t know it. This type of occurrence has been happening with the variants as well.
                
            <b> How fast is it spreading?</b>
                
                The number of people infected by SARS-CoV-2 changes every day. See our news story for the latest updates on this developing story.
                
            <b> COVID-19 preparation tips</b>
                
                In addition to practicing the prevention tips listed above, you can:
                
                Meet as a household or larger family to talk about who needs what.
                If you have people at a higher risk, ask their doctor what to do.
                Talk to your neighbors about emergency planning. Join your neighborhood chat group or website to stay in touch.
                Find community aid organizations that can help with health care, food delivery, and other supplies.
                Make an emergency contact list. Include family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, doctors, teachers, employers, and the local health department.
                Choose a room (or rooms) where you can keep someone who’s sick or who’s been exposed separate from the rest of you.
                Talk to your child’s school about keeping up with assignments.
                Set yourself up to work from home if your office is closed.
                Reach out to friends or family if you live alone. Make plans for them to check on you by phone, email, or video chat.
                Can a face mask protect you from infection?
                
                The CDC recommends that if you are not vaccinated, you should wear a cloth face mask if you go out in public. If you are at home with someone who has been infected or exposed, you should wear it as well. A mask is an added layer of protection for everyone, on top of social distancing efforts. You can spread the virus when you talk or cough, even if you don’t know that you have it or if you aren’t showing signs of infection.
                
                The CDC advises that surgical masks and N95 masks should be reserved for health care workers and first responders.
                
                Is it safe to travel during a pandemic?
                
                Crowded places can raise your chances of getting COVID-19. The CDC recommends against international or cruise ship travel during the pandemic. Restrictions are being eased for those who are vaccinated, and some areas are using “vaccine passports” as a way to open up to vaccinated travelers.
                
                A few questions may help you decide whether it’s safe to travel:
                
                Is the coronavirus spreading where you’re going?
                Will you have close contact with other people during the trip?
                Are you at higher risk of severe illness if you catch the virus?
                Do you live with someone who has a serious medical condition?
                Will the place where you’ll be staying be cleaned?
                Will you have access to food and other necessities?
                If you choose to travel, stay away from sick people. Wash your hands often, and try not to touch your face. Wear a cloth face mask when you’ll be around other people. All airlines require all customers to use them. They are also required on other forms of public transportation ushc as trains and buses.
                
                How can you help stop the spread of the coronavirus?
                
                Because the virus spreads from person to person, it’s important to limit your contact with other people as much as possible. and avoid large gatherings. Many states and cities have eased restrictions but this doesn’t mean the virus is gone. Continue to follow safety practices such as wearing a cloth face mask in public places and washing your hands.
                
                While many companies continue to use work-from-home practices, that is not possible for a lot of workers. Some people work in “essential businesses” that are vital to daily life, such as health care, law enforcement, and public utilities. Everyone else should countinue to limit your time in public as much as you can and wear a cloth face mask when you can’t. 
                
                The following terms have now become commonplace:
                
                Social distancing or physical distancing, keeping space between yourself and other people when you have to go out
                Quarantine, keeping someone home and separated from other people if they might have been exposed to the virus
                Isolation, keeping sick people away from healthy people, including using a separate “sick” bedroom and bathroom when possible
                Precautions should still be followed even if you are vaccinated.
                
                Coronavirus Vaccine
                On Dec. 11, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the U.S. for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Within a week, that agency also granted an EUA to a vaccine developed by Moderna. Johnson & Johnson's single shot vaccine was granted EUA in February, 2021. 
                
                The British government approved and began to give the Pfizer vaccine on Dec. 8, 2020. Vaccines developed in China and Russia are now also being given in several other countries. 
                
                Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses, taken a few weeks apart while J & J is just one shot. Health care workers and the elderly were originally given priority in receiving the vaccines but by May, the vaccines were made available to anyone over the age of 12 years-old.
                
                These vaccines were developed at an unprecedented speed, with testing in humans starting in March 2020. The FDA says that no corners were cut to allow for approval and that the innoculations are safe. The CDC has said it is safe for pregnant women and there's no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problem with pregnancy,.
                
                Clinical trials for other vaccines are still underway. If you're interested in volunteering for a COVID-19 vaccine trial, here are some sources of more information: 
                
                Government-sponsored sites:
                
                COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN). This is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and coordinated by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. Its goal is to enroll thousands of volunteers into COVID vaccine trials nationwide. Many research centers are using this site to find volunteers.
                
                Clinicaltrials.gov. This is a government database of public and private clinical studies done worldwide. The site also offers considerations for joining a clinical trial.
                
                Sites that link volunteers with trials nationwide include:

                Coronavirus Treatment
                There’s no specific treatment for COVID-19. People who get a mild case need care to ease their symptoms, like rest, fluids, and fever control. Take over-the-counter medicine for a sore throat, body aches, and fever. But don't give aspirin to children or teens younger than 19.
                
                You might have heard that you shouldn't take ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms. But the National Institutes of Health says people who have the virus can use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen as usual.
                
                Antibiotics won’t help because they treat bacteria, not viruses. If you hear about people with COVID-19 getting antibiotics, it’s for an infection that came along with the disease.
                
                People with severe symptoms need to be cared for in the hospital.
                
                The antiviral medication called remdesivir (Veklury) is the first medication to get FDA approval for treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Originally developed to treat Ebola, evidence shows that those treated with remdesivir recovered in about 11 days compared to 15 days for those treated with a placebo. 
                
                Many clinical trials are under way to explore treatments used for other conditions that could fight COVID-19 and to develop new ones.
                
                For instance, trials are under way for tocilizumab, another medication used to treat autoimmune conditions. And the FDA is also allowing clinical trials and hospital use of blood plasma from people who’ve had COVID-19 and recovered to help others build immunity. You’ll hear this called convalescent plasma. Currently, evidence of its effectiveness is limited.
                
                Early in the pandemic, the anti-malarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were considered as possible treatments. The FDA later rescinded an emergency use order because studies found that the drugs were ineffetive and the risks outweighed the benefits.
                
                A variety of steroid medications are being used including dexamethasone which is used to treat conditions such as arthritis, blood/hormone/immune system disorders, allergic reactions,. More studies on effectiveness are still being conducted.
